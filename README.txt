# alite - a lightweight procedural language

by Daniel Lyons <fusion@storytotell.org>

## Introduction

Alite is a very lightweight procedural language with emphasis on
Unicode. At the moment it is about as powerful as an integer `bc`. I
intend to draw on the ALGOL 60 reference to flesh out the language.

## Syntax Reference

Basic math operators: + - × ÷ ↑

Assignment: ← :=

You may use Unicode superscripts to indicate exponents as well as
Unicode subscripts to indicate base (not completely implemented yet).
